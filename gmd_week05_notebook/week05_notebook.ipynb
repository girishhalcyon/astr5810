It's through tools like these that we can connect remote sensing observations to the physics and chemistry of distant planets. I'd like you to see what some of the core steps would be!"

Assume $P_{\\rm rc} = 0.1~bar$, and that $\\gamma = c_{\\rm p}/c_{\\rm v} = 1.3$. Plot this $T-P$ profile, for altitudes spanning $P = 10^{-8}-10^{2}~bar$.\n",

If you were to calculate the radiative transfer through this atmosphere (keeping the $T-P$ profile fixed), roughly what brightness temperature would you expect to see at $15~\\mu m$, at $20~\\mu m$, and at $25~\\mu m$?

I *very* strongly recommend not doing this at the full resolution of your arrays (990001 wavelengths); make a crude approximation and only calculate outgoing intensities at a tiny subset of these (maybe 100-1000 wavelengths).
