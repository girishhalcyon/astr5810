These vertical profiles were mostly drawn from the datasets that Ray Pierrehumbert compiled for [Principles of Planetary Climate](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/~rtp1/PrinciplesPlanetaryClimate/). The only except is the 1976 US Standard Atmosphere, which I found in tabular form through a bit of googling.

They have tables have been standardized, so they all contain the same columns and in the same units. These are:

column 1 -- pressure in bar
column 2 -- temperature in K
column 3 -- density in kg/m^3
column 4 -- altitude in km

The sources for individual worlds include:

  Earth -- The US Standard Atmosphere (1976) is not an exact measurement. Rather, it is a representative vertical profile for Earth's atmosphere, that can be useful for approximate calculations at times.

  Jupiter -- Descent of the Jupiter Galileo probe.

  Mars -- Descent of Mars Pathfinder.

  Titan -- Descent of the Titan Huygens probe.

  Venus -- Descent of one of the Venus Pioneer probes.
